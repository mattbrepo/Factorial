# Factorial
Different ways to calculate the factorial:

* standard (i.e. triavial) algorithm
* [Log factorial](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/08/16/how-to-compute-log-factorial/)
* [Stirling's approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation)

**Language: C#**

**Start: 2015**

## Why
It seems mandatory for any programmer to go through how to calculate factorials!

## Example

Value: 7

```
Standard factorial: 5040
Log factorial: 5040
Stirling's approximation factorial: 4980.39583161246
```

[Binomial coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient) with:

* n: 100
* k: 10

```
Standard factorial 1: 17310309456440
Standard factorial 2: 17310309456440
LogFactorial: 17310309456441.1
